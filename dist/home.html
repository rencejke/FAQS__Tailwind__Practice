                                such challenging and unprecedented global times.</p></li>
                            <li><p>We also prioritize the holistic development and wellbeing of our students, their families, and our staff and faculty, providing periodic group counseling sessions for parents and students with a PRC-registered Guidance Counselor. We provide genuinely caring support for families, and host monthly Parenting Peer Groups (PPGs), which are gatherings (online/virtual if in-person is not possible) of small groups of parents to provide moral support and academic support to one another.</p></li>
                            <li> <p>FCA accepts students from diverse backgrounds, religions, and walks of life.

                                  desire for them to walk in the fullness of the promise of abundant life. This desire

                                environment that encourages collaboration of all stakeholders.</p></li>
