                                        a US Youth Leadership organization: “Growing Leaders”), 
                                        mentoring, and leadership development. We believe this 
                                        is something that our young people need, especially in 
                                        such challenging and unprecedented global times.</p></li>
                                    <li><p>We also prioritize the holistic development and wellbeing of our students, their families, and our staff and faculty, providing periodic group counseling sessions for parents and students with a PRC-registered Guidance Counselor. We provide genuinely caring support for families, and host monthly Parenting Peer Groups (PPGs), which are gatherings (online/virtual if in-person is not possible) of small groups of parents to provide moral support and academic support to one another.</p></li>
                                    <li> <p>FCA accepts students from diverse backgrounds, religions, and walks of life. Our primary language used for teaching and communication is the English language, except for the subjects of Filipino, Araling Panlipunan, and certain topics under Home Economics and Livelihood Education/Technology and Livelihood Education.</p></li>
